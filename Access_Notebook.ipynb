        "# Access Metrics Made Easy: Nearest Destination and Access Count\n",
        "This notebook provides a simple workflow and toolkit to calculate find access metrics. Primarily, this notebook calculates the nearest destination and the number of locations within a given threshold. The basic workflow is as follows:\n",
        "1. Import data: Point data for destinations, origin geographies, and a transit cost matrix of pre-computed travel costs (eg. Minutes, Miles, etc.)\n",
        "2. Spatially join destinations to origins: Based on the geospatial location, this associates each destination with an origin geography. Given that the travel cost between each origin geography is known, we can easily calculate the distance between.\n",
        "3. Calculate metrics: For the nearest location, we'll simply sort the list of origins and destinations by travel time, then take the first entry. For the count within a given threshold, we can filter the list of origins and destinations by the travel time, and count the number of entries under a given threshold.\n",
